Initialization file for YARL
Any line that does not start with a '[' is a comment.  Lines that do are data entries.  Data entries MUST be of the format [ENTRYNAME:ENTRYVALUE] (no spaces) or they will not be read correctly!

Window resolution

[WINDOWWIDTH:1024]
[WINDOWHEIGHT:768]



Fonts
Pick any font found in ./fonts.  Make sure the font attributes match the tags in the font name in GAMEFONT, or the game might display strangely.

[GAMEFONT:consolas12x12_gs_tc.png]
[FONTWIDTH:12]
[FONTHEIGHT:12]
[GREYSCALE:true] 'true' if the first tag is 'gs', 'false' otherwise
[FONTLAYOUT:tc] put the second tag here.  Can be 'as', 'ro', or 'tc' (without the quotes)
       



Renderer - which renderer the game uses.  Possible values are:
GLSL   : works only on video cards with pixel shaders
OPENGL : works on all video cards supporting OpenGL 1.4
SDL    : should work everywhere!
If the game does not display properly, runs slowly, or shows nothing but a black screen on startup, try changing this value. 

[RENDERER:SDL]



Log size - how many messages the game message log will hold in memory.  Increased log size will result in larger save games.

[LOGSIZE:500]

[LIGHTFLICKER:false] make 'true' if you want lights to flicker like realistic torches. 'false' by default.
