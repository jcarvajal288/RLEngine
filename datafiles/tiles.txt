(M) indicates a mandatory property, (O) indicates an optional one

Tile "Name of Tile"
{
    id (M) = number uniquely identifying this feature type.  This is the Tile's
             index into Tile::list.  It is not stored with the Tile, but is
             used for error checking during parsing.
    char (M) = character to display on the map.
    charSet (O)) = contains the characters to display for a tile that is directionally linked
                  or randomly linked.
    shortdesc (M) = a short description used when examining this feature
    longdesc (M) = a longer, possibly more flowerly description used for flavor
    bgColor (O) = background color of the feature's tile.  If not specified, 
                  the background color of the tile under it will be used.
    fgColor (O) = foreground color of the feature's tile.  If not specified, 
                  the foreground color of the tile under it will be used.

    // flags
    blocksLight = feature blocks light
    blocksWalk = feature blocks walking
    directionallyLinked = whether the tile's character changes based on similar tiles around it (Walls generally do this)
    notable = whether the player is notified when they walk over this tile.

    // actions
    actions take the form of "onFoo".  The number that follows indicates the id 
    of the feature that the current feature should turn into on that action.
    All actions are optional properties.
    Possible actions:
        onOpen
